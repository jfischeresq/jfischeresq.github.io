## Are you wondering if one-on-one coaching is right for you, or worth the investment?

<u>What is coaching?</u> I have developed a unique approach to 

<u>Why work with a coach</u>: Working with my clients and community, I have learned that in order to create real and lasting change, you need to commit to yourself with serious skin in the game. And, investing in a coach or mentor is potentially the best investment you can make in your own growth. It was, and contiues to be, for me, hands down, the best investment I make: <em>investing in myself</em>. It creates a sense of dedication directly tied to your commitment to growth. And, ultimately, that commitment leads to **results**.

<u>Who I coach</u>: I offer coaching for entrepreuners, lawyers, technologists, and new graduates looking to expand their careers and open or grow their opportunities to create a profession for themselves that can create satisfication, growth and your definition of success.  

<u>How much it costs</u>: I have a range of package options depending on your needs and goals. A one-time coaching session is $300. 

<u>Ready to learn more</u>? We can schedule a **free** 15 minute introductory session to see if we are a good fit to help <em>you</em> reach your goals. You can schedule that appointment via [this link](https://calendly.com/jordan-fischer/15min).

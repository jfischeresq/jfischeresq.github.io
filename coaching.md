## Are you wondering if one-on-one coaching is right for you, or worth the investment?

<em>I have certainly asked that same question over the years.</em>  

Working with my clients and community, I have learned that in order to create real and lasting change, you need to commit to yourself with serious skin in the game. And, investing in a coach or mentor is potentially the best investment you can make in your own growth. It was, and contiues to be, for me, hands down, the best investment I make: <em>investing in myself</em>. It creates a sense of dedication directly tied to your commitment to growth. And, ultimately, that commitment leads to <bold>results</bold>.

I believe strongly in transparency and open communication. Without my coaches and community, I would not have achieved the progress I have made over my career. And in working to commit to myself and my goals, I spent over tens of thousands of dollars. While this cost may seem high, I wanted to totally transform how I approach work, and how to define my success within my field. I pushed myself to month-by-month commit time and resources to getting results. And, those results continued to motivate me to keep going. And, in the end, the financial outlay created long-term benefits where I am still reaping the rewards.

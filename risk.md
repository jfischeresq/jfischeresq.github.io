In the Fall 2020, I co-taught a Design Research course at Drexel University as part of a year-long emphasis on the impact and approach to pandemics and crises. This Design Course pushed students to think critically and across dimensions on how to design solutions, incorporating the concepts of risk. A <em>HUGE</em> thank you to [Dee Nicholas](https://drexel.edu/westphal/about/directory/NicholasDiana/) for the amazing opportunity to teach together, and to learn so much during this process.

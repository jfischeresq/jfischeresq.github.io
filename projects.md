As part of my work, I am involved in a nnumber of different projects, with the aim of furthering my own knowledge in privacy and security, as well as to help to explore concepts impacting societal privacy and security. 

### My Current Research

Currently, I am working on a number of different projects, both academically and in the private sector:

1. <bold>Blockchain and Data Protection Laws</bold>

My initial research on this topic is summarized in this blog post, ["Blockchain and Data Protection Laws: Can they Co-Exist?"](https://xpanlawgroup.com/blockchain-and-data-protection-laws-can-they-co-exist/). 

I continue to expand my research, focusing on legislative and governmental approaches to creating workable solutions to creating blockchain solutions <em>with</em> privacy built-in. 

2. <bold>Operationalizing Privacy</bold>

One of the challenges in the privacy space for many entities is creating workable solutions to incorpriating privacy within their infrastructure. You can learn more about this project, and my forthcoming ebook, my visiting [Book](jordanfischer.me/book/).

3. <bold>Creating consistencies in global data privacy management</bold>

With the explosion of privacy regulations in most regions of the world, a key question is <em>how do we great effective global solutions to privacy that meet varying, and sometimes conflicting, legal requirements?</em> I work with multinational companies to research practical solutions to global privacy requirements.

### My Future Research Interests

In the near and distant future, I hope to work on projects on the following topics:

1. Creating workable solutions to privacy and security litigation to balance the protection of the individual and business innovation

2. The role of antitrust/competition law in promoting privacy and security in the private sector

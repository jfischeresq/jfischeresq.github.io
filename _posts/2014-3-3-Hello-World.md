### Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am so excited to launch my personal webpage! I am very thankful to have an opportunity to work on many different projects with many different colleagues, friends, and family members.  This webpage will be a way of providing access to those fun projects, and to explore more about my own growth and development!

What can you expect on here?

* First and foremost, my hope is to use the platform to discuss what it is like to open and run a business. The ups, the downs, and all of the in-between. Maybe this will inspire *you* to start your own business. Maybe it will help to demystify what it means to be a business owner/entrepreneur. When I went to start my business, I was looking for any and all information to help -- and I want to share what I have learned in my own journey!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

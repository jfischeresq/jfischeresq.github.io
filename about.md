### About Me
Welcome! This is my personal website where can learn about all of the projects and activities I am working on! Here are some fun things about me:
* I don't think I can ever sit 100% still. Sometimes, that can drive everyone around me *nuts*. 
* I am an avid dog lover! My dog, Brody is probably one of my strongest supports in life! My travel requires that he spend a lot of time with his doggie grandparents but I love getting home to be with him! (Picture of us together below!).
* I coded this entire website on GitHub. Yes, I am a lawyer. But, I am steadfastedly devoted to learning new and challenging things. Coding is soundly in that category! And, a **HUGE** thanks to [Conor Gilesnan](https://twitter.com/conorgil) for his continued patience with me learning the developer world!
I love, love, love being a **female entrepreneur** and building a business. It has been the greatest life challenge and the most rewarding thing to date. Yes, the days can be long, but the rewards are incredible. I hope that my story helps others to "take the leap" into entrepreneurship. I have never regretted it.

I wear many "hats" in my day-to-day life! It keeps things interesting -- if not hectic sometimes. 

#### Private Sector Lawyering
I co-founded and manage [XPAN Law Group, LLC](www.xpanlawgroup.com), a boutique international and domestic cybersecurity and data privacy law firm. We are very proud to be a certified Women’s Business Enterprise (“WBE”) and Women Owned Small Business (“WOSB”). 

My practice focuses on all components of cybersecurity, data privacy, and the data lifecycle. With a global perspective, my clients work with our XPAN team to create cost-effective and business oriented approaches to technology and governance. 

If you are loooking to connect with my private practice, please contact me at [jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com](mailto:jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com).

#### Professor Role
Providing educational opportunities to students across a variety of of different disciplines and backgrounds is a true joy. I hope to make privacy, security, and technology more understandable so that we can all work on solutions.  

* At Drexel University, I am a faculty member of the Thomas R. Kline School of Law. In that role, I educate law students in European data protection laws and general data privacy laws. I also work with undergradaute students at the Le Bow College of Business to provide basics in privacy laws. Check out my [Drexel profile](https://drexel.edu/law/faculty/fulltime_fac/jordan-fischer/).
* At Chestnut Hill College, I provide a course in the Master of Cybersecurity program focused on cybersecurity law. Check out the [CHC Master of Cybersecurity program](https://www.chc.edu/graduate-cybersecurity).

Welcome! This is my personal website where can learn about all of the projects and activities I am working on! I wear many "hats" in my day-to-day life! It keeps things interesting -- if not hectic sometimes. 

### Private Sector Lawyering
I co-founded and manage [XPAN Law Group, LLC](www.xpanlawgroup.com), a boutique international and domestic cybersecurity and data privacy law firm. We are very proud to be a certified Women’s Business Enterprise (“WBE”) and Women Owned Small Business (“WOSB”). 

My practice focuses on all components of cybersecurity, data privacy, and the data lifecycle. With a global perspective, my clients work with our XPAN team to create cost-effective and business oriented approaches to technology and governance. 

If you are loooking to connect with my private practice, please contact me at [jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com](mailto:jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com).

### Professor Role
Providing educational opportunities to students across a variety of of different disciplines and backgrounds is a true joy. I hope to make privacy, security, and technology more understandable so that we can all work on solutions.  

* At Drexel University, I am a faculty member of the Thomas R. Kline School of Law. In that role, I educate law students in European data protection laws and general data privacy laws. I also work with undergradaute students at the Le Bow College of Business to provide basics in privacy laws. Check out my [Drexel profile](https://drexel.edu/law/faculty/fulltime_fac/jordan-fischer/).
* At Chestnut Hill College, I provide a course in the Master of Cybersecurity program focused on cybersecurity law. Check out the [CHC Master of Cybersecurity program](https://www.chc.edu/graduate-cybersecurity).

### My Research
My research focuses on data privacy and cybersecurity, exploring the convergence of the law and technology and the practical implications of regional data protection regulations within a backdrop of the global economy. I like to apply my practical experience working with multinational companies to better understand the evolution of security and privacy within changing regulatory and legal frameworks to balance consumer and end-user rights with enterprise innovation and efficiencies. 

My goal: develop real solutions in the privacy, security, and technology space to help society address the growing reliance on our digital universe.

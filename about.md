### About Me
Welcome! This is my personal website where you can learn about all of the projects and activities I am working on! Here are some fun things about me:

* I don't think I can ever sit 100% still. Sometimes, that can drive everyone around me *nuts*. But, I secretly think it is my ultimate superpower!

* I am an avid **dog lover**! My dog, Brody is always up for cuddles, walks and runs in Philadelphia, and just hannging out! My travel requires that Brody visit his doggie grandparents often (who also spoil him a lot!). But, he will, I am sure, make many appearances on this website!

* I love to **travel**, and will take any excuse to hop on a plane to visit somehwere new, old -- you name it, I will agree to take the trip! My travel bug really took off in college when I lived in France (still one of my favorite countries!). 

* I **coded this entire website on GitHub**. Yes, I am a lawyer. But, I am steadfastedly devoted to challenging myself to continue to learn. And, coding is soundly in the category of "new" for me! A **HUGE** thank you to [Conor Gilsenan](https://twitter.com/conorgil) for his continued patience with me learning this often confusing developer world!

* I love, love, love being a **female entrepreneur** and building a business. It has been the greatest life challenge and the most rewarding thing to date. Yes, the days can be long, but the rewards are incredible. I hope that my story helps others to "take the leap" into entrepreneurship. I have never regretted it.

I wear many "hats" in my day-to-day life! It keeps things interesting -- if not hectic sometimes. 

#### Private Sector Lawyering
As I alluded to above, my first (but certainly not last) leap into entrepreneurship is [XPAN Law Group, LLC](https://www.xpanlawgroup.com), a boutique international and domestic cybersecurity and data privacy law firm which I co-founded and activity co-manage. I am so proud of the business we have built, our role in changing the dialogue in how to provide legal services, and promoting women-owned law firms. 

In my day-to-day practice, I focus on all components of cybersecurity, data privacy, and the data lifecycle. XPAN provides me with an opportunity to work with some really cool companies who are grappling with global perspectives in privacy, security, technology, and information governance. As a business owner myself, I try to maintain the perspective of creating cost-effective and business oriented approaches to these challenges. 

If you are loooking to connect with my private practice, please visit [XPAN's Website](https://www.xpanlawgroup.com) or contact me at [jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com](mailto:jfischer@xpanlawgroup.com).

#### Professor Role
I love teaching and working with students. It is a true joy to continue my learning journey by providing resources and courses across a variety of of different disciplines and backgrounds. My hope is that through these educational avenues, more of us can work together to create solutions to the challenges in privacy, security, and technology.  

* At Drexel University, I am a faculty member of the Thomas R. Kline School of Law. In that role, I educate law students in European data protection laws and general data privacy laws. I also work with undergradaute students at the Le Bow College of Business to provide basics in privacy laws. Check out my [Drexel profile](https://drexel.edu/law/faculty/fulltime_fac/jordan-fischer/).
* At Chestnut Hill College, I provide a course in the Master of Cybersecurity program focused on cybersecurity law. Check out the [CHC Master of Cybersecurity program](https://www.chc.edu/graduate-cybersecurity).
